#Little Quest
A fun, quick way to read short adventure stories where users have the option to choose the next part of the story.

#User Scenario A - Reader
As a reader I want to be able to log in, or register, and choose a story to read. 
Once I choose a story to read, I want to be able to make choices about how the story plays out. 
I want to be able to log out when I am done. If I am curious I want to be able to learn about who made the application. 
If I have a question or a problem I want to be able to email the team.

I want to be able to delete my information as well, in case I decide to leave the site permanently.

#User Scenario B - Writer (future stretch goal)
As a writer, I would like to be able to log in to a special writer portal where I can write stories
of my own with various options. I also want to know that my story is public domain. I want to also of course
be able to save my story or delete it if need be.

#User Scenario C - Admin (future stretch goal)
As an admin I want to be able to manage users, manage stories, potentially see 
statistics on popularity of choices per story, and popularity of the users stories.
Monthly and daily site traffic would be a huge plus as well.
