#Little Quest Team Agreement

##**Working Hours**
1. Unless otherwise agreed upon, or needed Thursday, since Amy comes in so much earlier, she can leave any time 3 or 4. Sooz & Nick will work roughly 8 - 5 or 9 -6 as schedules allow (Sooz has PT one day).
2. Daily start at 9:00AM at the latest. 

##**Planning**
We'll spend as much time as needed Monday maping user scenario views, CRUD paths, databases etc, before we start creating a task list using **GitHub kanban** and coding. Planning will hopefully save us!

Also on Monday, we'll decide on an MVP we think is doable to be completed by Wednesday with a nice list of stretch goals to tackle if we have time. 

##**Daily Programming**
1. SCRUM in the morning.
2. We'll pair program as needed with someone strong in a task or language (like SpringMVC, Java or other) with someone who wants to gain more experience. We'll also mob code and blockers and try to review code together (ideally with projector in class room) at least once a day, especially Wed/Thurs.
3. Mob programming any blockers.

##**GitHub/Heroku Process**
1. After scaffolding is built, master will be protected and only production branch can be merged to. 
2. Each task will have it's own branch and be named as such, for example "user-login". No one can approve their own pull requests. 
3. Team will merge when all present in the a.m. and then pull from production. Do so either right before, or after lunch, and at end of each day while all present.
4. Deploy to Heroku daily.

##Goals
1. MVP by 5:00PM Wednesday.
2. Stretch on Thursday along with design.
3. Friday morning practice presentation.
